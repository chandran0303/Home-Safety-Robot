# Home Safety Bot

A line follower bot which can detect gas leaks and high temperature in a typical household and raise an alarm if the threshold value is breached.


# Story

The number of deaths and injuries occurring at common households presents an alarming reality which has not been dealt with in all these years. It is with far more regret that we note that these deaths/injuries could have been prevented by appropriate alarms and warning mechanisms. The kitchen is by far the most dangerous room in the typical household. The number of deaths due to accidental gas explosions reached numbers in thousands. Another rising problem is one due to house fires which could be caused due to short-circuits, gas leaks, etc.

Our robot intends to help in this regard by raising an alarm when the threshold value obtained by the sensors is exceeded.

We believe further advancements can be made by adding IoT capabilities and adding sensors for other common household hazards.

# Components

 - Arduino Uno
 - IR Sensors
 - MQ2 Gas Sensor
 - LM35 Temperature sensor
 - Jumper wires

# Instructions

 1. Assemble the robot and ensure all connections are made with respect to the constants defined in the code.
 2. Upload the code on Arduino Uno
 3. Connect the battery and place the robot in a home layout
 4. Tune the threshold values of the gas and temperature sensor in the code according to your needs.
